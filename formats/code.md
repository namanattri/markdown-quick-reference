Code:
In this line I would like to mention `<pre>` tag and also `<header>` and `<section>` tag.

In the coming paragraph I will write a complete **JavaScript** code block to print _"Hello World"_ in console.

	function sayHello() {
		console.log("Hello World");
	}
	sayHello();

Now I'm going to add **html** code to say _hello world_:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head><title>Say Hello</title></head>
		<body>
			<p>Hello World!</p>
		</body>
	</html>
